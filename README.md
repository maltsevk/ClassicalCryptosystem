# ClassicalCryptosystem
It's a classical cryptosystem that uses vertical permutation and Vigenere cipher.

Vertical permutation. The size of the table is determined based on the size of the alphabet, i.e. is the divisor of the number of characters in clear text (the divisor must be greater than 2). If the number is simple, you need to add another one or two characters to the text. The key is generated by the program automatically and displayed on the screen.

Encryptor input:<br>
<li>binary file with an opened text to be encrypted.<br>
Encryptor output:<br>
<li>binary file with an opened text to be encrypted.<br>
<li>binary file with an opened text to be encrypted.<br>
<li>binary file with an opened text to be encrypted.<br>
